--ROLL COMMAND--
    -every invocation the user is asked how many die to roll and how many sides.
    -the roll will format like this ->  Dice: x Sides: y
    -----------------------------------> if dice > 1:
                                            result = f'{first roll} | {second roll} | {etc}...'
                                        else:
                                            result = f'{roll}'
